# ⚠️ WARNING: AI-GENERATED & UNTESTED
**THIS PROJECT WAS GENERATED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GEMINI 3 FLASH) AND HAS NOT BEEN TESTED ON PHYSICAL HARDWARE.**

> **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This software is intended for use with motorized MIDI faders and professional lighting control systems. Because it has not been validated with a physical iCon Platform M+ or an ETC Eos console, there is a significant risk of:
> * **Mechanical Damage:** Logic loops or incorrect MIDI data could cause motorized faders to grind or move erratically.
> * **System Instability:** Unhandled network exceptions could cause the bridge to crash during a show.
> * **OSC Flooding:** Incorrect configuration may flood your lighting network with UDP traffic.
>
> **Safety Recommendation:** Always test the software first with the fader power supply disconnected to ensure the logic and labels are working before enabling motor feedback.

# Eos MIDI-OSC Bridge (iCon Platform M+)

A high-performance, asynchronous bridge connecting the **iCon Platform M+** (with D2 Display) to **ETC Eos Family** lighting consoles. Built in Rust for ultra-low latency.



## ✨ Key Features
- **Bi-directional Motorized Feedback**: Faders move on your iCon when they move in Eos.
- **D2 Display Support**: Automatically pushes Eos fader labels (e.g., "Front Light", "Haze") to the iCon scribble strips.
- **Fader Touch Sensitivity**: Mutes feedback while you are touching a fader to prevent "motor fighting."
- **Page Navigation**: Bank `<` `>` buttons on the iCon move the Eos fader page and refresh all labels.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## ⚙️ Eos Console Configuration

To enable communication, go to **Setup > System > Network > OSC** on your Eos console:

1. **OSC RX Port**: `8000`
2. **OSC TX Port**: `8001`
3. **OSC TX IP Address**: The IP of the computer running this bridge.
4. **OSC UDP**: Ensure "UDP" is selected.
5. **OSC TX (Transmit)**: Set to **ON**.

## 🎹 iCon Platform M+ Setup

Your controller must be in **Mackie Control (MCP)** mode:  
1. Turn off the iCon.  
2. Hold down the **Encoder button on Channel 1**.  
3. Turn on the power.  
4. Rotate the encoder to select **"MCP"**.  
5. Press the encoder again to save and exit.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Download
Grab the latest binary for your OS from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eos-midi-bridge/releases) tab.

### Manual Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikacousin/eos-midi-bridge.git
cd eos-midi-bridge
cargo build --release
```

🧩 Default Mappings
By default, this app is pre-configured for:  
* Faders 1-8: Eos Faders 1-8 (of current page).  
* Fader 9 (Master): Eos Fader 9 (of current page).  
* Bank < / >: Page Up / Page Down.  
* Scribble Strips: Displays Eos Target Names.  
🧪 Troubleshooting  
* No Labels? Ensure "OSC TX" is ON in Eos and the IP address is correct.  
* Motors Fighting? Ensure your iCon is in MCP mode so the Touch Sensitivity notes are sent correctly.  
* Windows Firewall: You must allow UDP traffic on ports 8000 and 8001 when prompted.
